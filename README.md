# Apache Kafka Demo Project: Node.js and Spring Boot

This repository contains two separate demonstration projects that showcase the usage of Apache Kafka with Node.js and Spring Boot applications. Each project includes both a producer and a consumer who interact with Kafka topics. Additionally, the Node.js project includes Dockerfiles for containerization, enabling easy deployment using Docker.

## Introduction to Apache Kafka

**Apache Kafka** is an open-source stream processing platform and message broker widely used for building real-time data pipelines and streaming applications. It is designed to handle high-throughput, fault tolerance, scalability, and durability of data streams. Kafka is based on a distributed publish-subscribe messaging model and guarantees strong durability by persisting messages on disk.

- Usage
Both projects, whether Node.js or Spring Boot, demonstrate the producer-consumer interaction with Kafka. The producer sends messages to a Kafka topic, and the consumer processes those messages. You can monitor the logs of both the producer and consumer to see the Kafka interactions.
